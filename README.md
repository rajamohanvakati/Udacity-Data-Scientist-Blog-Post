## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>


With nearly 90 000 responses fielded from over 170 countries and dependent territories, <b>Stack Overflow Annual Developer</b> Survey continues to be the most comprehensive survey of software developers ever conducted. The survey covers aspects such as career satisfaction and job search to programming languages.

For this project, I was intersected in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand of  

- What is the programming language of choice?
- What's the pay for developers ?
- What is the framework of choice for developers?
- Are developers satisfied with their career?
